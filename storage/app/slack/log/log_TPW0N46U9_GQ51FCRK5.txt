Dear Naomi Yamanishi san
I have problem with Diagonal background.
Currently, I use background gradien to adjust it.
Ex: background-image: linear-gradient(to left bottom, #f3f5f8 0%, #f3f5f8 49.5%, transparent 50%);

However, 49.5% is not exactly. If I change size of browser, My Diagonal background can be broken.

Now, I think about border (shape css). If I make it by border, I need use JS ( auto calc border size) and I need to use empty tagname ( empty tagname is not good for "clean code" standard
