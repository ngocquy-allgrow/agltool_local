Thank you! I'll check it now.

Is it possible to change the breakpoint settings depending on the layout (image placement) and the font and margin values?

Font size and margins will still switch at 812px device width.
The arrangement of the images changes depending on the orientation of the screen.
Is it possible??

Currently, I have set the layout change on orientation. I also set fonts and margin based on breakpoint 812px. Is there anything I haven't done right here?

Thank you, Dong.

Hi, Dong!
I have one request to you about our site you created yesterday.
When browsing the site with a smartphone or iPad, if you set the height at 100vh depending on the browser, the display may be shifted by the height of the address bar of the browser.
Is there another way to solve this problem?

I will research it. It may take about 30 minutes
